## Hi there, my name is Tatiana Carvajal ðŸ‘‹
I graduated from university as a nurse but after working for two years I realized that I wanted to change career and thatâ€™s why, in the last year Iâ€™ve been learning iOS development, taking multiple courses, getting certifications, and creating personal projects. Being a developer who had a different career, my goal is to improve my skills and inspire people to make a change that allows them to have a better life.
